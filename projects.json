Each robot is released on the web, driving a modified version of Google’s Chrome browser, to periodically visit sites that it 'likes', and to click links that it selects, which then bring it to new sites. This process continues over several weeks, during which the robot collects, as it has been trained to do, all of the advertisements it is served based on its profile (generally several thousand or more), applying each to a single polygon on the mesh skin of the virtual avatar it inhabits. The training period concludes when the robot’s 3-dimensional figure is complete.",

The project was recently presented at Eyebeam, MIT, and the New School, covered by Wired magazine, and featured at Transmediale in Berlin. <br><br />AdNauseam developed from an earlier project entitled TrackMeNot, which similarly protected users from data profiling by issuing generated decoy queries to search engines.

Verses appear on the faces of separate translucent cubes nested within one another. The reader manipulates a mouse, joystick, or touch-screen to bring stanzas on different surfaces into view. As cubes, faces, and layers are revealed, dynamically updating lines of text move in and out of focus. The structure of the poem facilitates a multiplicity of readings: from single verses on cube faces, to sequential verses across faces, to juxtapositions of verses across multiple cubes. Meaning is constructed actively through collaboration between reader, author, and mediated work. An audio track of the authors' layered voices extends the experience, enveloping the reader in the atmosphere of the poem, organically complementing the visual and tactile components of the work.",
